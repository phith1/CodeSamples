Project Descriptions
--------------------
**Information Retrieval** (CMSC 476, 676 for graduate students) tasked students with creating algorithms to draw connections between documents based on the contents inside them. The final assignment was to implement an agglomerate clustering algorithm in Python that would recursively group similar-enough files together.

**Machine Learning** (CMSC 478, 678 for graduate students) tasked students with using Machine Learning algorithms to analyze test data and make judgments about input data.  My final project involved understanding and processing data from SAMHSA's 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). I used a combination of Python and SPSS to prune down over 3,000 variables to around 20. Then, I leveraged WEKA to test if social determinants of health or other unexpected variables proved to be reliable indicators of serious mental health diagnoses.
