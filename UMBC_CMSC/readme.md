# UMBC Computer Science Program Code Samples

Project Descriptions
--------------------
**Information Retrieval** (CMSC 476, 676 for graduate students) tasked students with creating algorithms to draw connections between documents based on the information (words) contained inside them. Early phases of the project were teamwork-based, so there are mentions of that within the PDF reports.

**Machine Learning** (CMSC 478, 678 for graduate students) tasked students with using Machine Learning algorithms to analyze test data and make judgments about input data.
