# UMBC Computer Science Program Code Samples

Project Descriptions
--------------------
Information Retrieval (CMSC 476, 676 for graduate students) tasked students with creating algorithms to draw connections between documents based on the information (words) contained inside them. Early phases of the project were teamwork-based, so there are mentions of that within the PDF reports. \ \

476 HW5, Clustered Similarity Matrix: https://www.csee.umbc.edu/~nicholas/676/term%20project/hw5.html \ \

Machine Learning (CMSC 478, 678 for graduate students) tasked students with using Machine Learning algorithms to analyze test data and make judgments about input data. HW2 implements k-means clustering to analyze a MNIST handwritten digit dataset. My Final Project fed NSDUH 2013 data into a Python, SPSS, and Weka to determine if any recorded variables had a greater influence on diagnosis with a mental health disorder. A Python script calculated the information gain of all relevant variables, SPSS was used to prune all unnecessary data, and the remainder was fed into WEKA to build decision trees. \ \
